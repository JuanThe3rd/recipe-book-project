Looking for a comunity of fellow cooks? Stop on by and look at the freshest recipes and add favorites or delete your least favorites.

# User Storyies

- As a user I want to be able to save recipes. Will have a button that will show if a recipe has been saved or not on the card.
- As a user I find that it would be great to submit my awesome recipes so that other people can enjoy them. Will have a form submit page so that users will be able to add new recipes.
- As a user I would love to see what recipes others love by looking at ratings. On each recipe will be able to see the rating on the card.
- As a user I dont want to see some recipes anymore as I like to keep things fresh so I would like to delete them. On each card there will be a button to delete a recipe so you no longer have to see them.
