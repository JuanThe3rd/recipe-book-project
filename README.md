# recipe-book-project

as a user i want to be able to save recipes. will have a button that will show if a recipe has been saved or not on the card
as a user i find that it would be great to submit my aswsome recipes so that other people can enjoy them. will have a form submit page so that users will be able to add new recipes
as a user i would love to see what recipes others love by looking at ratings. on each recipe will be able to see the rating on the card
as a user i dont want to see some recipes anymore as i like to keep things fresh so i would like to delete them. on each card there will be a button to delete a recipe so u no longer have to see them
